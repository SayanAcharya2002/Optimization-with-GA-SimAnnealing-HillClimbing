This repo contains modular, object-oriented implementation for Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Hill Climbing optimization techniques.
The abovementioned methods were tested on the Rosenbrock function and some more custom functions.
A logger was added to log the results in a neat and clean way.
